# Agentic Coding

::left::

## When to use
- Working on a repo you don't know very well
- Short shelf life projects
- Repetitive tasks (use commands for this)
- Low complexity (writing mapper)

::right::

## When not to use
- You know the code base inside out

AND:

- Long shelf life and sensitive code
- Code architectural decisions
