# Gemini CLI Introduction Workshop

A [documentation](https://sli.dev/) slides deck for Gemini CLI workshop I have hosted.

All run scripts are in [package.json](package.json)

It contains a survey using SurveyJS and a hands-on lab using popular 2048 game.

## Demo

Use `workshop` branch for a step by step workshop checkpoints. This can save time or when LLM diverges from expected path for the workshop.
